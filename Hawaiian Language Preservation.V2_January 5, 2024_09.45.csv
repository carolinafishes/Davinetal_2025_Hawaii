1. Students who attend Hawaiian Immersion Schools who have been put back in English public schools… they are often VERY far behind their peers and that worries me. Worry, not because if the Hawaiian, but that lack of qualified teachers that teach in the immersion schools. I have also attended training and worked with immersion teachers and they struggle to get staff which often ends up with anyone who knows the language being tasked to teach and that does not always lead to good teaching.

2. The quality and rigor of subjects beyond Hawaiian Language in immersion schools.

This is in direct opposition of the other students who try for the Seal in a language that they attain by study, in an environment that lacks that studied language and lack of native speakers. (in Hawaii, this means students learning European languages and students mastering the reading/writing systems of the Asian languages).  English is the language accepted globally for international communication so proficiency in English has become imperative for every country.  Languages like Hawaiian, Okinawan, and other native American ones are essential for preservation of culture , cultural beliefs, values, practices (traditions), and products. However, it is not essential to know the language to live in this modern age.  And the overly emphasized focus on native Hawaiians and the Hawaiian language sometimes results in a form of ""racism"" against those who do not think the same way and has many youth shunning the multicultural bloodline they possess to only focus on recognizing their native Hawaiian ethnicity, which usually constitutes less than 20% of their ethnic bloodline, to ignore the other family ethnic backgrounds (from the sailors and plantation workers that came to Hawaii from Norway, Portugal, China, Japan, and the Philippines) that make them unique.",I do not want a gift card.,
