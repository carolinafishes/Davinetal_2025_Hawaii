I was only told about it when it was time to take it, and for that me and many of my classmates were not able to receive it due to the fact that we did not know the requirements. And I tried to raise my GPA fast but because I had a C in math I wasnt able to get it. It hurt because getting a C in math didnʻt affect my ability to speak both English and Hawaiian. And that showed when I took the test and passed with a good score, but still could not get the seal because of my GPA. I just wish we knew sooner, because it feels like I wont be able to get the recognition of going to immersion my whjole life and learning our mother tongue.
